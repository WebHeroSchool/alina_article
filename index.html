            <p>Early spring usually resounds with chattering birds and ice cracking as it melts… Not so this year, and not just </br> because of the warming climate: March will resound with music, music and more music! From the star-studded </br> first concert of this year’s <strong> ICE Classic</strong> cycle, the celebrations of the <strong>European Early Music Day</strong>  and the </br> Cracovian instalment of the <strong>Ludwig van Beethoven Easter Festival</strong>, to Kraków Philharmonic returning with a </br> festival dedicated to its patron <strong>Karol Szymanowski</strong> , there is plenty to choose from! The Academy of Music in </br> Kraków hosts the piano festival <strong>Duettissimo</strong> , the <strong>Bach Days</strong>  and the <strong>Kraków Cello Spring</strong> . The international </br> social project <strong>“Orfeo & Majnun”</strong>  comes to ICE Kraków with an opera intertwining stories of legendary </br> protagonists from different eras and cultures, revealing the universal power of love. And, almost as a </br> counterpoint, the Kraków Opera presents a premiere of a brand-new interpretation of the story of Orpheus… </br> Improvised music? <strong>The London Jazz Composers Orchestra</strong> , founded in 1970, presents three concerts! How about</br> classic rock? <strong>Santana, Red Box</strong>  and the <strong>“Poets of Rock”</strong>  concert explore music of the last half-century.
                Or</br> perhaps some lighter sounds? Gipsy Kings take us on a journey to the hot climates of Andalusia and put a spring </br>in our step. Finally, designs presented at the <strong>Cracow Fashion Week</strong> and the <strong>International Biennial of Interior </br> Design</strong>  remind us that it is time to throw our windows open to air our homes and wardrobes… </p>
